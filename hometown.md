## Tanjung Pinang
### The City of Diversity

__Tanjung Pinang__, the second largest town after Batam in the Riau Archipelago, today has grown into the capital city of the entire province. 
Tanjung Pinang sited at the strategic location at the south western coast of the Island of Bintan. 
This city becomes the entry port to explore the many wonders that Riau Archipelago has offered. 
In July 2004, Riau Archipelago is separated from Riau Province. The current Riau Archipelago includes Karimun, Batam, Bintan, Singkep-Lingga.

Tanjung Pinang is full of diversity with multiple ethnic communities. It successfully attracts migrants from outside though it is not a big town. 
You can easily find mosques, churches, Hindu temple, and vihara along its main road, where Malay, Bugis, Banjar, Java, and Sumatran live peace in harmony.
